****GO OVER BIT CHAPTER 5 
bit tricks:
    0110 + 0110 is the same as 0110 * 2 so just shifting bits to left once: 1100
    0100 == 4 so multiplying by this you would shift bits left twice
        ex: 0100 * 0011 = 1100
    
    two's complement:
        flip bits and add 1 (left most is signed bit)

    logical right shift >>> :
        shift all bits right 1, put 0 in most sig bit (left-most)

    arithmetic right shift >> :  (roughly divide by 2)
        shift all bits right 1, put sign bit in most sig bit
